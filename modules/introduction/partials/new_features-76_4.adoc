=== Cluster Manager

* *https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63871[MB-63871]:*
The `/prometheus_sd_config` endpoint  provides a new option `clusterLabels`
that specifies the cluster will return its name and  UUID.
Prometheus will use the labels in time series data.
This provides a method
to guarantee uniqueness for stats with the same name
gathered from multiple clusters.
