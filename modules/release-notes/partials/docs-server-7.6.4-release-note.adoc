=== Fixed Issues

This release contains the following fixes:

==== Cluster Manager

[#table-fixed-issues-764-cluster-manager,cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-62219[MB-62219]
| The cluster manager was unable to rotate the root certificate when a new root uses the same private key as the old root.
| Issue resolved.

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-62413[MB-62413]
| When a username is extracted from a client certificate, the candidate username is checked for its existance in couchbase-server. If such user doesn't exist, algorithm now doesn't stop, but tries to extract another candidate username.
|Issue resolved.

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63981[MB-63871]
| The /prometheus_sd_config endpoint  provides a new option `clusterLabels` which species the cluster name and cluster UUID be returned. Prometheus will use them as labels in time series data. 
| This provides a method to guarantee uniqueness for stats with the same name gathered from multiple clusters.

|===

==== Storage Engine
[#table-fixed-issues-764-storage-engine,cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63261[MB-63261]
| An issue occurred caused by a race condition in the index recovery code path, which may result in item count mismatch and wrong query results. +
Prior to Release 7.6.0, this  issue may occur during an Indexer restart.
However, as part of the file-based rebalance process introduced in 7.6.0, a recovery of the index is performed after the index is moved, which increases the likelihood that the race condition might be reached.
| The race condition has been addressed and the issue is resolved.

|===

==== XDCR
[#table-fixed-issues-764-xdcr,cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-62383[MB-62383]
| In rare situations, a document with a very large CAS could be inserted into a bucket. It  was possible for XDCR to replicate this document with malformed CAS to other clusters.
| XDCR now has built-in guardrails to prevent documents with malformed CAS beyond a certain drift threshold from being replicated and then to notify the user if this situation occurs via UI and logs.

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-62410[MB-62410]
| Connection Pre-check did support all inputs normally accepted by XDCR
| XDCR connection pre-check now supports alternate addresses, DNS SRV, and works identically to XDCR remote cluster references.

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63738[MB-63738]
| The XDCR dashboard on Source cluster now shows a UI alert when a pipeline is stuck due to EACCESS errors while writing to Target cluster.
| Issue resolved.

==== Query Service
[#table-fixed-issues-764-query-service,cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-62932[MB-62932]
| The execution of prepared statements containing (`*`) expressions in the projection can return incorrect results in scenarios where the encoded plans of such statements need to be decoded before execution.

| Issue resolved.

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63016[MB-63016]
| If an index is defined with a `CASE` statement as an index key, and the `CASE` statement contains a not-equal expression, and the same `CASE` statement is used in the projection clause of a query, then the covering index scan is not performed properly.
| The issue is fixed, and we now use covering index scan appropriately.

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63069[MB-63069]
| In versions `7.6.2`, and `7.6.3`, queries with a `FROM` clause containing an `UNNEST` and `ORDER BY` with a `LIMIT` or `LIMIT + OFFSET` clauses, then in some cases incorrect results were observed when the `ORDER` could not be pushed down to the indexer.
| Issue resolved.

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63414[MB-63414]
| If `memory_quota` is set to a value and Query uses a non-covered array index, it can result in `Request has exceeded memory quota` error.
| Issue resolved.

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-64155[MB-64155]
a| In previous versions of Couchbase Server, a clear delimiter between a numeric constant and a keyword was not required. 

| From version `7.6.4+`, a statement containing text such as: `… 1AND …`
  will now correctly generate a syntax error indicating it is an invalid number. +
  Correct such instances by inserting a space between the numeric constant and the following token, e.g. `… 1 AND …`.

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63518[MB-63518]
|An API issue has been resolved where attempting to set the completed-stream-size to zero when it was already zero via the administrative REST API would:

   * Prevent stream completion.

   * Block access to the system:vitals keyspace or vitals end-point.

   * Require a full Query process restart on affected nodes as the only previous workaround.

| Issue resolved.

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63420[MB-63420]
a| A server panic was resolved when processing an aggregate function with a less-common reference structure, such as MAX([d.date, d][1]). The more standard form MAX([d.date, d])[1] was not impacted. The fix ensures stable query processing for this edge case.

| Issue resolved.

==== Eventing Service
[#table-fixed-issues-764-eventing-service,cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63014[MB-63014]
| In earlier versions of Couchbase, during eventing function deployment or resumption, KV service disruptions (like network partitions) could leave LCB instances in an unrecoverable, unhealthy state. This caused the eventing function to become permanently stuck, with subsequent operations failing to return control, rendering the function non-functional.

| This issue has been resolved. Couchbase Eventing now actively monitors LCB instance statuses and implements a "lazy" retry mechanism for bootstrapping unhealthy instances. The retry process continues until the operation times out, which is dynamically determined by the script timeout. This ensures that JavaScript code remains responsive, with mutations timing out gracefully if bootstrap attempts fail, instead of causing a complete function lockup.

==== Index Service
[#table-fixed-issues-764-index-service,cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-61387[MB-61387]
| To speed up the initial process of building the index,
the index service has an optimization that skips checking for existing entries and directly adds new ones.
This optimization is crucial for the initial build but should not be used for updates to existing indexes.
Unfortunately, in a rare sequence of events, all indexes might be enabled for this optimization,
leading to duplicate entries in the storage layer, leading to incorrect results.
| The optimization is now only enabled for those indexes that are undergoing an initial build process.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-62220[MB-62220]
| We have an optimization in place which avoids unnecessary index movements when a swap rebalance is performed.
A minor bug in this optimization interfered with rebuilding user-dropped replicas/lost replicas during such a rebalance
where we didn't consider new nodes coming in when placing lost indexes.
| Adds a sorted pseudo-random order where we give higher priority to new incoming nodes  followed by old nodes staying in the cluster when we try to place lost indexes.
Hence, we can repair lost replicas.

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-62919[MB-62919]
| After enabling GSI shard-based rebalance from the Web UI and saving the settings, it was not possible to disable the same setting by unticking the box. The box is greyed out and cannot be interacted with.
| Issue resolved.

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63276[MB-63276]
| An issue in the rebalancer caused several partitions to miss streaming mutations when partitioned indexes were moved during file-based rebalances.  This issue resulted in corrupt indexes as not all data was processed. +
The issue occurred only with partitioned indexes with file-based rebalances enabled.
| Issue resolved.

==== Search Service
[#table-fixed-issues-764-search-service,cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-62427[MB-62427]
| In index definitions from version 6.x, the `segmentVersion` parameter is absent, with it previously defaulting to v11. With 7.6 we’ve updated the default to v16. So when the `segmentVersion` is absent, the v16 code will be going into effect.

An issue in the v16 code while interpreting data with no vector fields caused an alignment panic. This panic is fixed with 7.6.4 allowing 6.x index definitions to work ok in 7.6.4.

   * This problem occurs only for index definitions that survive an upgrade from 6.x to 7.x and then 7.6.x without being “re-built” meaning they’d still be using the v11 file format.

   * Indexes that were introduced in server version 7.x and later or re-built after the cluster was fully upgraded to 7.x (which will have a segmentVersion:15 setting within their index definition) will not encounter this issue, because they invoke the v15 code.

| In summary, version 7.6.4 now supports upgrades of 6.x index definitions. However, Couchbase recommends upgrading indexes to 15+ segment version format for improvements in indexing footprint and performance.

| Issue resolved.

==== Backup Service
[#table-fixed-issues-764-backup-service,cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-61013[MB-61013]
| The Backup service incorrectly allowed backups to be created in the data directory
because the server could delete the backup files.
| The server will not allow archives to be created in the data directory.
